Hands-On ROS 2 for Robotics Programming
--------

Robot development is a complex system engineering task. ROS 2 offers strong support for intelligent robot development, greatly improving development efficiency. This book first introduces ROS 2's basic concepts, communication mechanisms, libraries, and tools, helping readers get started with ROS 2 robot development. It then guides readers through practical tasks such as robot modeling/simulation, mapping/navigation, and custom controller/planner development. In the real - robot section, readers build a physical ROS 2 - based robot, bridging the gap between simulation and reality. Finally, the book delves into advanced ROS 2 usage, laying a solid foundation for further practical robot development with ROS 2. Considering readers' backgrounds, examples are implemented in both C++ and Python, with additional explanations of C++ features, Git, multithreading, and callback functions.
