3.6 Chapter Summary and Review
==========================

This chapter has been packed with valuable content. Focusing on the ROS 2 topic communication mechanism, we not only learned how to use topics for communication in both Python and C++, but also explored speech synthesis and closed-loop motion control along the way. Topic communication is the first of the four major communication mechanisms in ROS 2 and is also the most widely used in robot development.

In the best practices section on topic communication, you must have gained a lot. While practicing with topics, we not only mastered how to customize communication interfaces but also learned how to obtain real-time system status information and how to create interfaces using Qt in ROS 2. Through this best practices example, I believe you have gained a deeper understanding of topic communication and the use of ROS 2.

Additionally, at the end of this chapter, we further learned how to set up a repository and commit code using Git. Of course, this is just an initial exploration, and we will continue to delve into more Git-related content in the future.
