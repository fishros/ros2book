1.2.4 Installing ROS 2
=======================

After completing the installation of Ubuntu, we can proceed to install ROS 2 on this system. There are two methods to install the ROS 2 binary packages: manually or by using an installation tool. For beginners, using the installation tool is more convenient, so we will directly use the installation tool for installation.

In the Ubuntu system, right-click on a blank area of the desktop and select "Open in Terminal" to open the terminal as shown in Figure 1-18. All our subsequent operations will be performed in this black box, which somewhat resembles the terminals used by hackers in movies, doesn't it?
