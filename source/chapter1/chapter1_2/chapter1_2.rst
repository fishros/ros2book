1.2 Setting Up the Development Environment
==========================================

As the old saying goes, "To do a good job, an artisan needs the best tools." A convenient and efficient development environment can significantly speed up our development process. Therefore, in this section, I will guide you step-by-step in setting up the development environment.

ROS 2 is installed on an existing operating system. Although ROS 2 supports Windows, using a Linux system can make the installation and development process more convenient. There are several methods to install a Linux system, such as installing a virtual machine on Windows and then installing Linux on the virtual machine, or directly installing Linux on your computer alongside Windows for a dual-boot setup. For the initial parts of this book, using a virtual machine is sufficient. However, for later stages involving robot modeling, simulation, and development with physical robots, it is recommended to use a physical machine running Linux for better performance.

The FISHROS2OS tool can be used to quickly install a dual-boot system with Linux and Windows on a portable disk. You can visit https://www.fishros.org.cn/forum/topic/1835 for more information. Next, we will introduce the method of installing Linux on a virtual machine.
