1.2.1 Preparing Required Software
================================

To install a Linux system on a virtual machine, you need to prepare the following software:

- **VirtualBox**: VirtualBox is an open-source virtualization software that allows you to install other operating systems on your computer, such as the Linux operating system required for learning ROS 2.

- **Linux System Image**: In this case, we will use the Ubuntu 22.04 system. Generally, operating systems based on the Linux kernel are referred to as Linux systems, and Ubuntu is one of the Linux operating systems primarily focused on desktop applications.

- **ROS 2 Installation Package**: The ROS 2 installation package consists of hundreds of individual packages. You don't need to download and install them one by one. On the Ubuntu system, you can automatically download and install them from the server using simple commands.
