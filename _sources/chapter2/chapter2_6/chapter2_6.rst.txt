2.6 Chapter Summary and Comments
==========================


There is indeed a lot of content in this chapter, with so many lines of code written. It would be surprising if you didn't feel tired, but you must also feel very fulfilled. In this chapter, we first learned how to write ROS 2 nodes using Python and C++, and then we learned how to organize nodes with packages and workspaces. Finally, we acquired a great deal of programming knowledge, which has laid a solid foundation for our future learning. It's no exaggeration to say that you have now successfully entered the world of ROS 2 development.
However, your journey in ROS 2 robot development has only just begun. We still need to keep working hard. Take a break for a while to adjust to the best state and continue your journey of learning ROS 2.
