Introduction
====================================================

Hello everyone! Welcome to the learning journey of **"FishROS"**! I'm Jade, your companion throughout this adventure into the world of ROS 2, where you’ll experience the limitless charm of robotics development!

About This Book
---------------
This book was authored by **Mr. Xin Sang**, the founder and lead instructor of the "FishROS" community. Since its establishment in July 2021, the community has been dedicated to sharing ROS 2 knowledge through a series of well-received tutorials. With the growing community and invaluable feedback from readers, Mr. Sang decided to systematize and refine the content, leading to the creation of this book—**"FishROS"**—a work born out of dedication and passion.

In China, this book is called "鱼香肉丝", which is similar to FishROS. We hope this book, like the delicious dish "Yuxiang Shredded Pork," will bring you from a taste of robotics to a deep, lingering appreciation—leaving you fulfilled and satisfied as you conquer ROS 2 step by step!

Unique Features of This Book
----------------------------
Unlike other ROS books, this book is designed with **reader needs as the primary focus**. It integrates valuable feedback from readers of the "Hands-On Learning ROS 2" tutorial series, refining and optimizing the content to address common pain points.

1. **For Beginners - Smooth Onboarding**
    Many beginners struggle with programming and environment setup. This book covers essential Linux and Git knowledge in the first few chapters, progressively guiding readers through the basics of ROS 2.

2. **Focus on Practicality - Learn by Doing**
    A common issue readers face is learning the theory but not knowing how to apply it. To address this, the book includes numerous practice exercises, helping readers master the skills needed for real-world applications. For example, you’ll use ROS 2 to implement voice synthesis, facial recognition, and GUI rendering, experiencing the true power of ROS 2.

3. **Strengthened Simulation Modeling**
    To help readers understand the simulation modeling process in ROS 2, this book provides detailed guidance on creating and simulating robot models, integrating ros2_control to achieve movement control in the simulation environment. This sets a solid foundation for real-world robot development.

4. **In-Depth Hardware Development with micro-ROS**
    For hardware enthusiasts, the book introduces **micro-ROS**, offering a complete guide to developing physical robots from scratch. It covers everything from connecting to ROS 2, controlling the robot, to mapping and autonomous navigation.

5. **Advanced ROS 2 Applications - Beyond the Basics**
    Looking to go deeper with ROS 2? The final chapter delves into advanced topics, including **Quality of Service (QoS), Executors and Callback Groups, Lifecycle Nodes, Message Filters**, and **DDS Middleware**. These advanced tools will help you handle performance and reliability challenges in complex scenarios.

Course Structure & Content Overview
====================================

**This book is divided into five main parts:**

Part 1: ROS 2 Basics *(Chapters 1–5)*

Covers the **core software libraries and toolsets of ROS 2**, helping you quickly grasp topics, services, actions, parameters, and nodes.
Through hands-on exercises, you'll create ROS 2 workspaces, write simple packages, and lay a solid foundation for deeper learning.

Part 2: Simulation and Modeling *(Chapter 6)*
---------------------------------------------
Focuses on **creating and controlling a simulated mobile robot** from scratch.
You will use **URDF**, **Xacro**, and **Gazebo** to build models, and integrate **ros2_control** to achieve motion control in simulation.
This sets the stage for autonomous navigation and real-world deployment.

Part 3: Autonomous Navigation *(Chapters 7–8)*
----------------------------------------------
- **Chapter 7**: Builds on the simulation model, introducing the **Navigation 2 (Nav2) framework** for autonomous navigation.
  You’ll learn map setup, path planning, and obstacle avoidance.
- **Chapter 8**: Teaches how to **deploy custom planning and control algorithms** in Nav2 to implement personalized behavior.

Part 4: Physical Robot Development *(Chapter 9)*
------------------------------------------------
Guides you through **building and controlling a physical robot** with **micro-ROS** integration.
You'll apply mapping, localization, and navigation techniques on real hardware, bridging simulation and reality.

Part 5: Advanced ROS 2 Topics *(Chapter 10)*
--------------------------------------------
Explores **advanced ROS 2 features**, including:

- Quality of Service (**QoS**)
