1.3 Running Your First Robot
===========================

Interestingly, the little turtle holds special significance for ROS. Just like ROS 1, each version of ROS 2 uses a different species of turtle as its mascot. Figure 1-19 shows the logo of the ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill version. Similar to how the first program written when learning a programming language is "Hello World," the first example we run when learning ROS 2 is the turtle simulator.
