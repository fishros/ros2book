1.1 Introduction to the ROS Community
======================================

Since its birth, ROS has released over 20 official versions. Over the past decade-plus, it has grown with an open-source spirit, forming a strong community of OSRF, robot-related businesses, and developers. Developers are key to this ecosystem; millions have contributed code, driving ROS's prosperity. For an operating system, this ecosystem is crucial. For example, China's Harmony OS initially supported Android apps for ecosystem-related reasons. Historically, robot operating systems like Player died out due to a lack of ecosystem.

ROS is loved by robot developers for good reason. Next, let's look at ROS from a developer's perspective. Pure theory can be dull, so I'll use examples and diagrams to explain.
