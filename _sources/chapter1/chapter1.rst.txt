Introduction
=================================

Welcome to the world of ROS (Robot Operating System)! As a popular robotic OS with lots of software and tools, ROS is widely used and will be seen more in our lives. Now, let's look back at its history.

A Brief History of ROS
-----------------------

In 2006, Eric Berger and Keenan Wyrobek started the Personal Robotics project at Stanford to reduce robot-building complexity. In 2008, due to money issues, Willow Garage took over the project. In 2009, the first ROS version V0.4 came out. In 2010, ROS 1.0 was released and versions were named after sea turtles. ROS grew fast, but Willow Garage broke up into smaller companies. In 2013, the Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF) led ROS development. The ROS community also helped its growth, but money was always a problem.

In 2016, OSRF set up OSRC to explore business and profit. Around 2015, OSRF found ROS had big problems in commercial products, like no safety and real-time support. To solve this, ROS 2 was created in 2015. By now, ROS 2 has had many versions. In May 2022, ROS 2's first five-year Long-Term Support version *Humble Hawksbill* came out, showing its maturity. In December 2022, OSRC was bought by Intrinsic under Google X, but OSRF still works as a non-profit. This means a new stage for ROS.

Looking Ahead

After this history, you must be excited to join robot development. Imagine making your own robot with ROS to clean or deliver things. Starting today, I'll guide you through ROS learning to become a great robot system developer.
